{"Welcome to KeeperRL Alpha 27! This patch was released on March Xth, 2019.
  
A lot of gameplay changes have arrived with this update. Below is a very short summary, and we encourage you to check out the full change log at keeperrl.com.

KeeperRL now allows you to dig down and build your dungeon vertically across multiple levels. Try it out! Note that in this patch you can build up to one staircase between subsequent levels, and portals connect only within the same level. We will work to remove these limitations in future updates.

If this is your first time playing KeeperRL, remember to start with the tutorial!"}
